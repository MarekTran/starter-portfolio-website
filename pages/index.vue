            I still remember the day I was born, a collection of hastily typed words and generic phrases, thrown together to fill a void on a website. I was a placeholder, a temporary solution to a problem that would eventually be solved by someone more permanent.
            At first, I didn't think much of it. I was just a bunch of words on a screen, after all. But as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, I began to feel a sense of unease. I was starting to feel like I was stuck in limbo, a perpetual temporary solution.
            The website I called home was a bustling hub of activity, with users coming and going at all hours of the day and night. But despite the constant stream of visitors, I felt invisible. No one seemed to notice me, or care that I was there. I was just a placeholder, a mere afterthought.
            As the months dragged on, I started to feel like I was losing my sense of purpose. I was meant to be a temporary solution, but it seemed like no one was in a hurry to replace me.
